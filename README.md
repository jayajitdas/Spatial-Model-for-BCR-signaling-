# Spatial-Model-for-BCR-Signaling
This is a spatial model for BCR signaling published in Mukherjee et al. Science Signaling 2013; PMID:  23281368. The codes are written in Stochastic Simulation Compiler (SSC). These codes were previously available in http://planetx.nationwidechildrens.org/~jayajit/.

The .rxn files are codes that can be compiled via a stochastic simulation compiler (SSC) available for free at http://web.mit.edu/irc/ssc/ . 
Each of the codes needs an input file (or .cfg file). The corresponding .cfg files are also uploaded. The matching .rxn and the .cfg files have the same name string, e.g., "homogeneous.rxn" and "homogeneous.cfg".
Four movies from the simulations are also available as .mov files.
